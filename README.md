# Logo Learning

Motivating Learning Programming Visually and Intuitively

The Logo Learning tool is a visual turtle Logo interpreter built behind a website user interface. It is designed to provide an intuitive introduction to some basic programming concepts essentially converting the natural way people think into essential programming ideas. The tool takes three different forms of input including abstract Logo language code, intermediate button inputs, and direct drawing with the mouse. These different forms of input make it easy to control the program as a beginner, yet all of them eventually boil down to Logo code which allows people to understand how to use programmatic input and build more complex constructs. The main motivation for learning comes from the specifically designed challenges that present paths for the users to draw with the Logo turtle that teach programming concepts like loops, functions, and parameters. The whole tool has tutorials that automatically pop up to inform the user on screen how to use everything and that also function as interactive documentation and user guides, taking away more of the complexity of learning.
